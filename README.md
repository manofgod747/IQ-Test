# IQ Test
The object of this paper is to investigate a formal test of intelligence.

To create a test of intelligence one needs to define what intelligence is. To answer this question we turn to the fundamental building blocks of thinking and all language. Logic.

Logic is the process of stating facts and making deductions from the facts. Deductions are the first, second to n:th order of facts evident from the basic facts or principles.

Something that is intelligent must be able to hold facts in memory and deduce conclusions. Higher intelligence has higher capacity for holding facts, i.e. more memory. Higher intelligence has higher capabilities to deduce auxiliary facts from the state of facts.

Hypothesis

* Intelligence increases exponentionally in relation to increased neuron count.
* When the chain of deduction is too complex for intelligence, a heuristic must be used, i.e. argumentation error.

Design

* The test should be designed to examine deduction length capability. 
* Time limit is not necessary.
* Number of questions can be small. One question might be enough.
* Each individual will reach different conclusions depending on neuron count.
* It should be impossible to cheat.
